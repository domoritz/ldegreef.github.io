            I am a PhD student at the <a href="http://cs.washington.edu">University of Washington</a> with an NSF fellowship and Microsoft Research PhD fellowship, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/shwetak">Shwetak Patel</a> in the <a href="http://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu">Ubiquitous Computing Lab</a>. Within the broad spectrum of ubiquitous computing, my interests include computer vision, embedded systems, machine learning, and HCI. My current research focuses on lowering the access barrier to medical care, using low cost commodity hardware with trained image analysis and innovative user interface design.
