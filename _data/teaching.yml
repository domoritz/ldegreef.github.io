- title: "HMC CS 70: Data Structures and Program Development"
  role: Grader and Tutor (Grutor)
  offerings: Fall 2010, Spring 2012
  professor: Melissa O'Neill, Ben Wiedermann
  location: Harvey Mudd College
  description: "CS 70 is the most intense course in Harvey Mudd's core computer science curriculum; for their first time in the program, students design and implement programs from scratch, learn C++ in depth, and experience strict grading rubrics that emphasize coding style and rigor. I hosted and tutored students in office hours and graded homework assignments as part of a team of grutors. My tutoring hours became so popular that I usually kept a mental queue of who I was supposed to help next, often approached by people asking “enqueue?”"

- title: "HMC Winter Physics Workshop"
  role: Teaching Assistant
  offerings: Winter 2010
  professor: Patti Sparks
  location: Harvey Mudd College
  description: "To help students who entered Harvey Mudd College with less physics experience, I helped assist the first iteration of a one-week intensive workshop that took place during winter break. Rather than a comprehensive review of background physics, it focused on developing the tools needed to do the work in the physics course of mechanics (Physics 24). With one other assistant, roles included attending all class sessions, and tutoring students through exercises during class sessions and homework assignments."
